# Tanstack Query Tutorial Example

This repository contains the code examples demonstrated in the "Mastering Tanstack Query for React" tutorial. In the tutorial, we cover how to use Tanstack Query (formerly React Query) to simplify data fetching, caching, updating, and synchronization within a React application.

## What You’ll Learn

- **Fetching Data with `useQuery`**: Learn how to simplify data fetching using Tanstack Query’s `useQuery` hook.
- **Caching and Stale Time**: See how Tanstack Query automatically caches results and refreshes stale data.
- **Multiple and Parametrized Queries**: Understand how to handle different queries, including dynamic parameters.
- **Mutations with `useMutation`**: Explore creating, updating, and deleting data on the server with seamless UI updates.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Improve user experience with instant UI responses that roll back if something goes wrong.
- **Pagination and Infinite Queries**: Implement smooth infinite scrolling and paginated data fetching.
- **DevTools**: Utilize built-in DevTools for debugging and visualizing query states.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tanstack-query-tutorial.git
   ```

````

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd tanstack-query-tutorial
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code Structure

- **`src/index.js`**: Entrypoint that wraps the app with `QueryClientProvider`.
- **`src/App.jsx`**: Main component demonstrating fetching data with `useQuery`.
- **`src/CreatePost.jsx`**: Example component showing how to perform mutations, invalidate queries, and implement optimistic updates.
- **`src/PostDetails.jsx`**: Shows how to fetch data for a single post using a parameterized query key.
- Additional snippets and components may be included to demonstrate concepts like pagination or infinite scrolling.
